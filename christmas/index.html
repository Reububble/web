	<h1>Reuben & Alison's Christmas Wish List Website.</h1>
	Generally:
	<ul>
		<li>Boardgames</li>
		<li>Teapot</li>
		<li>Experiences</li>
		<li>Money</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Boardgames</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Preferably at least 5 player</li>
		<li>Hopefully less than 2 hours. 1 hour is great though.</li>
	</ul>
	Examples
	<ul>
		<li>
			Settlers of Catan <b>Extension</b><br>
			I have the base game. 5-6 player extensions exist for all of their different Catan expansions, but I have
			the base
			game and so want the base game extension. It should be red.</li>
		<li>
			Dominion <br>
			I don't have a photo. Pester me if you want me to bother to add one. Remember that there are expansions
			which don't include the base game, so don't get an expansion before I have the base game</li>
		<li>
			Battlestar Galactica <br>
			This one is hard to find because it's not being made anymore, so it could be really expensive if you do find
			it.
			Remember there's more than one game which might be called Battlestar Galactica. I want <a

		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2> Teapot </h2>
	Alison would like this teapot <img src="AlisonTeapot.jpg">
	<h2> Experiences </h2>
	We will enjoy pretty much anything.
	<h2>Money</h2>
	We are starting to need new phones, and phones are apparently expensive now.
